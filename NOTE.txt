GITHUB Actions
---
We can use github with cypress directly to  test any files we commit
i remove the record key before github deployment
    "test": "cypress run --headless", 
Not related to this course:
Github projects has actions which i should look at later 

To create actions from our project we would need to create a yml file
Whenver github sees a yml file, github knows it a github action and runs it
Start by creating a .github folder in the root of our folder 
then workflows and cypress.yml
visit https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action for the yaml for the actions but now have
the cypress.yml filled with comments about

After adding the cypress.yml we when do the typpicall add, commit push then go to Actions in github repo

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO INSTALL THE EXTRA PACKAGES YOU MIGHT HAVE IMPORTED IN CYPRESS IN PACKAGE.JSON
For this initial process, our test actuall failed with this error
"we get an error   > Cannot read property 'filter' of undefined"
We want a better error so first we need to instaall a package to get the browser error since we are using heaadless
npm install --save-dev cypress-log-to-output

then we add it the plugins folder at index.js at the end of line
'require("cypress-log-to-output").install(on)'
then blah blah bah comit, push again
this time you would notice more but more defined error

"
 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
URL: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?language=en-US&sort_by=popularity.desc&include_adult=false&
include_video=false&page=1&api_key=undefined
"

This shows that the api is undefined

since we are not sending our env, no api key is sent 
but have the data in fixtures -> movieList so we want to use any apikey and use fixture and intercept to return data 
we add the fake key in our cypress.json
then we use fixture and intercept in tour.js 
we also want our app to hhave access to the fake api 
so in our git repo we go to settings -> secrets -> new repo secret ( button at the  top right)
add name REACT_APP_MOVIE_API
value fake 
--. above is based on the values in cypress.json since we want the cypress to match the app
then in the cypress.yaml add
` env:
    REACT_APP_MOVIE_API: ${{secrets.REACT_APP_MOVIE_API}}`
secrets -> this refers to the secret we have added in our repo
This is how we would add secrets in future for testing
