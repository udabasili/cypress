GITHUB Actions
---
We can use github with cypress directly to  test any files we commit
i remove the record key before github deployment
    "test": "cypress run --headless", 
Not related to this course:
Github projects has actions which i should look at later 

To create actions from our project we would need to create a yml file
Whenver github sees a yml file, github knows it a github action and runs it
Start by creating a .github folder in the root of our folder 
then workflows and cypress.yml
visit https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action for the yaml for the actions but now have
the cypress.yml filled with comments about

After adding the cypress.yml we when do the typpicall add, commit push then go to Actions in github repo
